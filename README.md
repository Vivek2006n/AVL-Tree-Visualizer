# AVL Tree Visualizer

An interactive web application that demonstrates the operations of an AVL Tree—a self-balancing binary search tree—through real-time visualizations. Users can insert values into the tree and watch it balance itself with smooth rotations.

## Overview

The AVL Tree Visualizer is designed to help learners and developers understand how AVL Trees maintain balance using rotations during node insertions. This project not only demonstrates the underlying AVL Tree logic but also provides an interactive, visual representation of tree operations such as left rotation, right rotation, and the combined cases (LR and RL rotations).

## Features

- **Interactive Input:** Insert integer values into the AVL Tree using an input field.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch the AVL Tree update dynamically as new nodes are added.
- **Rotation Animations:** Visual demonstration of all AVL Tree rotation cases (LL, RR, LR, and RL).
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure of the web application.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Implements the AVL Tree logic and handles user interactions.
- **D3.js:** For powerful and dynamic visualizations of the tree structure.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vivek2006n/avl-tree-visualizer.git
2. **Open the Application**

You can directly open the index.html file in your browser.
Alternatively, run a local server:

##Usage
- Enter a Number: Type an integer into the input field.
- Insert the Number: Click the "Insert" button to add the value to the AVL Tree.
- Watch the Tree Update: The AVL Tree will adjust itself with the appropriate rotations, and you will see the changes reflected visually in real-time.
